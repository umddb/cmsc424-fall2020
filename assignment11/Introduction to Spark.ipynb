    "\n",
    "Apache Spark is a relatively new cluster computing framework, developed originally at UC Berkeley. It significantly generalizes the 2-stage Map-Reduce paradigm (originally proposed by Google and popularized by open-source Hadoop system); Spark is instead based on the abstraction of **resilient distributed datasets (RDDs)**. An RDD is basically a distributed collection of items, that can be created in a variety of ways. Spark provides a set of operations to transform one or more RDDs into an output RDD, and analysis tasks are written as chains of these operations."
