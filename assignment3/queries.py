### 1. Write a query to find the maximum, minimum, and average population in 2010 across all states.

### 3. Write a query to find the number of candidates who are listed in the sen_state_returns table for each senate election held in 2018. 
### Note that there may be two elections in some states, and there should be two tuples in the output for that state.
### 'NA' or '' (empty) should be treated as candidates.

### 4. Write a query to find, for the 2008 elections, the number of counties where Barack Obama received strictly more votes

### 5. Write a query to find the names of the states with at least 100 counties in the 'counties' table.

### 6. Write a query to construct a table:

### Use the ability to "sum" an expression (e.g., the following query returns the number of counties in 'AR')

### 7. Create a table to list the disparity between the populations listed in 'states' table and those listed in 'counties' table for 1950 and 2010.
### Result should be:

### 10. Use Set Intersection to find the counties that Barack Obama lost in 2008, but won in 2012.

### 12. Create a table listing the months and the number of states that were admitted to the union (admitted_to_union field) in that month.

### 13. Create a view pres_state_votes with schema (year, statecode, candidatename, partyname, candidatevotes) where we maintain aggregated counts by statecode (i.e.,
